- Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
    - Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. They wanted Global Rain, our company, to tell them how to protect their organization from external threats. Our company was tasked with identifying security vulnerabilties with their web-based software application. 

- What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
    - What I think I did well after finding my client's software security vulnerabilities was recommending the proper fixes in my mitigation plan. It's important to code securely because it protects a company by protecting sensitive data, preventing financial losses, and it maintains their reputation. 

- What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
    - I would say the most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was looking through each vulnerability listed in the dependency-check to find out how to fix each one. This was also helpful because I realized a lot of issues can be solved by making sure ever dependency is upgraded to the latest version.

- How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
    - I increased layers of security by implementing input validation, cryptohgraphy, and secure communcation protocols. In the future, I would do a manual review of the code and use static testing tools in order to assess vulnerabilties and decide which mitigation techniques to use. 
    
- How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
    - I made certain the code and software application were functional and secure by testing after refactoring the code. After refactoring the code, I ran another dependency-check to see if any new vulnerabilties showed up. 
   
- What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
    - I used the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram, static testing tools, and coding practices like input validation and encapuslation. These can help guide me in future assignments or tasks by giving me a proper way to go about identifying issues in code. 
    
- Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
    - I might show my future employers my ability to do a vulnerability assessment and create a mitigation plan to address the issues I found. I might also show them how I used static testing tools to help indentify vulnerabilties quickly.
